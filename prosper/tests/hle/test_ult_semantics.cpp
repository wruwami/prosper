// test_ult_semantics.cpp — #1603 Phase 2: libSceUlt must have REAL semantics, not visible refusals.
//
// Every assertion here fails on the Phase 1 tree (every entry point returned SCE_KERNEL_ERROR_ENOSYS
// and no state existed at all), and each is written so that it also fails for the *interesting* wrong
// implementation, not merely for the absent one:
//
//   * the mutual-exclusion check runs real concurrent threads over a non-atomic counter and asserts
//     both an EXACT total and a direct occupancy invariant. A no-op mutex does not crash — it
//     produces a wrong-but-plausible number, which is precisely why the exact total is the contract
//     and a "did it run" check would be worthless. Measured against a forced no-op lock: 68,636
//     overlapping critical-section entries and 27,984 of 40,000 increments surviving.
//   * the work-area check asserts the size the query returns is the size Create demands, so the two
//     cannot drift apart into a number nobody honours.
//   * the object-header check proves a zeroed (uncreated) and a destroyed object are both REFUSED, so
//     the magic is load-bearing rather than decorative.
//
// The Ult object the guest owns is a 256-byte caller-allocated blob; these tests allocate the same
// shape so prosper's 16-byte header lands where it does in the guest.
